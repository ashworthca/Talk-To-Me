Description:
This is a Simple iOS Application for all screen sizes that will allow the user to type words  and phrases on a large keyboard within their screen, and the application will read it back to them.

I built this application as a fun tool for my step daughter, Paige  (Who is eight with nonverbal Autism) to use so she can label the objects and people she sees around our home. It works in a similar manner to her Proloquo2go,  in that after you press a letter (by default) the letter is spoken back to the user. When the user taps on the completed word or phrase, it is spoken back to them.

Paige is eight years old, with nonverbal Autism. She is very bright and smart and makes connections with everything she sees around her. I made this simple application to aid as a communication vehicle.  With this simple to use application we found out that she was able to spell words that we had no idea she knew!  Within a few minutes of using the “Talk to Me” app, she was able to type out “BUTTERFLY”, a word no one knew she could spell.

Paige has always used her Proloquo2Go for communication and the goal for building this application as an aid to work alongside her Proloquo2Go.

This application is in no way meant to replace Proloquo2Go!
