This is a Simple iOS Application for all screen sizes that will allow someone to type words and press them on the screen and the application will read it back to them.

I build this application as a fun tool for Paige to use so she can spell some words that she sees around the house.  It works similar to her Proloquo in that after you press a letter (by default) it will say that letter.  Then when you tap on the word or letters that she has typed it, it will speak them.

Paige is an 8 year old girl who is very bright but struggles with communication.  She is a non-verbal girl with Autism.  With this tool we found out that she was able to spell words we had no idea.  The first time she saw a butterfly after using the application for a few hours she was able to spell out butterfly within the application.  We had no idea that she was able to spell that work.  She has always used her Proloquo2Go for communication and I wanted to build this application as a helper or an aid to work alongside her Proloquo2Go.
